1.Collection is a framework is have predefined classes and interface so we can modifie 
,later we can reused the method can it reduce the programming effort.
collection is inherited from the iterable ,and collection have 4 interfaces.
1.list
2.set
3.treeset
4.sorted setr
difference beetween list and set is
list                                                 set
1.in list we can strore duplicate values          1. in set we can store only unique value only
2.it is index based                               2. it is not index based
3.it is fallow insertion order                    3.it is unorder
3.it allow position access                        4.it not allow position access
5.it have both iterator and list iterator         5.it is only have iterator only
so we can access the element in both the 
direction like forword direction and backword 
direction

2. implementation of the map are 1.linkedmap,2.treemap,3.hashmap

3.difference beetween hasmap and treemap is where tree is follow accending order 
and hash map is fallow insertion order.
 

8. String Operation with Streem 
strem have filter mathod,collector method ,for each method, and in filter we 
can use isEmpty,contains,containsall methods.
9.Spring Core is a openSourceFrameWork, which have inbuilt methods and so it 
create object withod using the new keyword,with the help of the Configuration
we can scan the Component Scan so  find the Component Annotation in the class and
it create the object of the bean.

10. the Dependency injection can be achive by IOC and where one cass have the referece
of the another class.

11. we can inject the bean by @Autowired.if we have similartype of the method then we can
differencess them by add @Qulifiear Annotation.

12.yes we can have more than one cofiguration file in the project.

the spring get get to by giving the write annotation .
13. String Buffer                                           String Builder
    1. it is mutable                                        1. it is also a mutable
     2. it is slow in forformance                            2. it is fast in forformance
     3.beacouse it it is exicute the 
method in one by one                               3. it execute the all the method in parlally.


14.2. IOC  where it is depending on the dependencies injection where it have the reference the
onother class.
    4.@Componet is where store the metadata so we can transwer to the congiuration 
    5.@ComponetScan it find the where the Componet Annotation is present with the help of paccake
we can find the componnet
    6.@Bean is used to create the abject and register te object
16. public class Country{
public static void main(String m[]){
Map<String,Interger> map=new TreeMap<String,Interger>();
map.put("india",235);
map.put("china",45);
map.put("america",48);
map.put("srilanka",36);
map.put("pakistan",52);
map.forEach((m)->System.out.println(n+" "+m);
map.forEach((n)->if(n.contains("china"){System.out.println(n)};
map.remove("china",45);
}
}

17. 1.Maven is the open sorce framework which is used to downlod the jars and dependeicies
   which is used in the spring 
   3. TomCat is the sofware where it is used  to share the data from one computer to 
onother computer with help of server.
    4.Quarkus is a dependencie jar which help to validate the our data without doing mannually.
    
18.public class Country{
public static void main(String m[]){
List<String> list=new LinkedList<String>();
list.add("mahin");
list.add("Syeda");
list.add("summu");
list.add("mehatb");
list.remove("mahin");
list.remove("mehatab");
list.forEach(n->System.out.println(n));
}
}

}
